# BaymaxBot
A friend of mine wanted to make a Baymax bot, so I thought i'd give her a hand :)

The application will include:

-A few files to get the bot up and running
-A README with the commands that the bot can perform.
-A file that lets the bot track time spent exercising
-A file that is called upon if someone says "ow", prompting the bot to try to find the cause of discomfort (sounds kinda hard tbh)
-
